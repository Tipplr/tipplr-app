User story #1: ability to filter the provided cocktail recipe list to view only the recipes possible with current inventory

    eventlistener on button click

        filter based on userInventory (see story #5)
        //outputs filtered array of Cocktails filteredCocktails []

User story #5 which ingredient would most broaden the drinks possible 
    filter( (# userInventory IN this.specs) === specs.length-1) 
        // creates almostPossible[] 
            // an array of cocktails for which all ingredients except one can be found in userInventory[]
            // this COULD be the same function as the filter for "is possible", with an argument of 1 passed as the "tolerance". When the function gets used for "is possible", we would pass an argument of 0. 
    get highYieldBottle and corresponding newBottleRecipes[]    
        // from almostPossible[] or at the same time, create array of one-off missing ingredients
        // .reduce() oneOff[] to get total additional cocktails possible per missing ingredient
        // .sort() to get highYieldBottle, the highest number of new possible drinks 
        // use highYieldBottle to .filter() through specs in almostPossible[] to produce newBottleRecipes[]
    render highYieldBottle and highYieldRecipes[]
    
        
User story #6 quick access to the appâ€™s cocktail recipes and search feature with minimal clicks/prompts
    // primarily HTML/CSS driven
User story #7 alert notifying me that site users must be at least 21 years old
    //this is accomplished at the page load
