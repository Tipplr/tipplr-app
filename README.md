### Project Description:
Andrew is a bartender by trade with a substantial collection of bottles at home for making delicious cocktails for himself and guests. He uses a fun app that has fantastic recipes and some helpful features, but the search function is extremely limited, such that when he wants to see what he can make with what he has on hand, he can only search one ingredient at a time. Then he has to read through multiple recipes to determine if he has all the other ingredients, too. We want to build an application that enables the user to filter a list of cocktail recipes based on what they actually have on hand, add their own recipes, organize and save their favorites, or get recommendations on the next bottle they should add to their collection to significantly increase the number of drinks they can make at home.
